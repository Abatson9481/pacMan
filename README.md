# pacMan
This activity allows you to move the Pac Man to the end of the screen and switch directions, while opening and closing his mouth-- just like the game!

How to Run:
1. Download files locally
2. Load the index.html file onto your web browser
3. Watch the Pac Man chomp his way to the edge of the page and back!

Future Improvements:
1. Create dots for the Pac Man to eat
2. Create ghosts to chase him like in the game
